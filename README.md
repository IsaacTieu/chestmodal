# Radiology Image Classification with Multimodal Learning

This project highlights a deep learning model to classify radiology conditions from chest X-ray images (in DICOM format) and associated radiology reports. It utilizes both image and text data to improve diagnostic performance across multiple pathologies.

## üìÅ Dataset

The model is trained and evaluated on the **MIMIC-CXR** dataset, which contains:
- Chest X-ray images in DICOM format
- Corresponding radiology reports in text format

## üß† Model Overview

The model follows a multimodal architecture:
- **Vision Encoder:** CNN-based model for processing DICOM images
- **Text Encoder:** Transformer-based model for embedding radiology reports
- **Fusion Layer:** Combines visual and textual features
- **Classifier:** Predicts the presence or absence of various conditions (indicated by -1, 0, and 1)

## Training

- The model was trained with semi-supervised learning techniques
- I ran into issues with exploding gradients, which was fixed with Xavier initialization
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) was also used to help stabilize the parameters and increase generalizability
- This was trained on a subset of 500 images and their corresponding text reports over 25 epochs
- To improve metrics, the dataset can be migrated to the cloud and trained on an HPC for more epochs

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies from `environment.yml`
3. Prepare the dataset with the instructions in `dataset`
4. Pre-process DICOM + text files with `process_data.py`
5. Ensure that there are four `csv` files in `processed_data`
6. Train or evaluate the model using:
   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```

## Deployment

- This model was containerized into a Dockerfile and deployed with FastAPI
- Get and predict endpoints were created, which can be scaled to deploy this model on a variety of platforms
- Visit `app` for instructions


## üìå Future Work

- Improve classification for underperforming classes (e.g., Lung Lesion, Pleural Other)
- Incorporate clinical metadata
- Explore attention-based fusion techniques
